description: This file explains the scheme evaluator, which includes looking at several
  different parts of the language design and telling how to support the syntax of
  the language, how to create and manipulate the environments, how primitives are
  installed into the initial or global environment and how to put together the overall
  infrastructure for letting a user interact with the evaluator.
